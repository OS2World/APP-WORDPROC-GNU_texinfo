<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Tips and Hints</h2>

<p>Here are some tips for writing Texinfo documentation:

  <p><a name="index-Tips-1251"></a><a name="index-Usage-tips-1252"></a><a name="index-Hints-1253"></a>
     <ul>
<li>Write in the present tense, not in the past or the future.

     <li>Write actively!  For example, write &ldquo;We recommend that <small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo; rather
than &ldquo;It is recommended that <small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo;.

     <li>Use 70 or 72 as your fill column.  Longer lines are hard to read.

     <li>Include a copyright notice and copying permissions. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Index, Index, Index!</h5>

<p>Write many index entries, in different ways. 
Readers like indices; they are helpful and convenient.

  <p>Although it is easiest to write index entries as you write the body of
the text, some people prefer to write entries afterwards.  In either
case, write an entry before the paragraph to which it applies.  This
way, an index entry points to the first page of a paragraph that is
split across pages.

  <p>Here are more hints we have found valuable:

     <ul>
<li>Write each index entry differently, so each entry refers to a different
place in the document.

     <li>Write index entries only where a topic is discussed significantly.  For
example, it is not useful to index &ldquo;debugging information&rdquo; in a
chapter on reporting bugs.  Someone who wants to know about debugging
information will certainly not find it in that chapter.

     <li>Consistently capitalize the first word of every concept index entry,
or else consistently use lower case.  Terse entries often call for
lower case; longer entries for capitalization.  Whichever case
convention you use, please use one or the other consistently!  Mixing
the two styles looks bad.

     <li>Always capitalize or use upper case for those words in an index for
which this is proper, such as names of countries or acronyms.  Always
use the appropriate case for case-sensitive names, such as those in C or
Lisp.

     <li>Write the indexing commands that refer to a whole section immediately
after the section command, and write the indexing commands that refer to
a paragraph before that paragraph.

     <p>In the example that follows, a blank line comes after the index
entry for &ldquo;Leaping&rdquo;:

     <pre class="example">          @section The Dog and the Fox
          @cindex Jumping, in general
          @cindex Leaping
          
          @cindex Dog, lazy, jumped over
          @cindex Lazy dog jumped over
          @cindex Fox, jumps over dog
          @cindex Quick fox jumps over dog
          The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">(Note that the example shows entries for the same concept that are
written in different ways&mdash;`<samp><span class="samp">Lazy dog</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">Dog, lazy</span></samp>'&mdash;so
readers can look up the concept in different ways.) 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Blank Lines</h5>

     <ul>
<li>Insert a blank line between a sectioning command and the first following
sentence or paragraph, or between the indexing commands associated with
the sectioning command and the first following sentence or paragraph, as
shown in the tip on indexing.  Otherwise, a formatter may fold title and
paragraph together.

     <li>Always insert a blank line before an <code>@table</code> command and after an
<code>@end table</code> command; but never insert a blank line after an
<code>@table</code> command or before an <code>@end table</code> command.

     <p>For example,

     <pre class="example">          Types of fox:
          
          @table @samp
          @item Quick
          Jump over lazy dogs.
          
          @item Brown
          Also jump over lazy dogs.
          @end table
          @noindent
          On the other hand, ...
     </pre>
     <p>Insert blank lines before and after <code>@itemize</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>@end
itemize</code> and <code>@enumerate</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>@end enumerate</code> in the
same way. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Complete Phrases</h5>

<p>Complete phrases are easier to read than <small class="dots">...</small>

     <ul>
<li>Write entries in an itemized list as complete sentences; or at least, as
complete phrases.  Incomplete expressions <small class="dots">...</small> awkward <small class="dots">...</small> like
this.

     <li>Write the prefatory sentence or phrase for a multi-item list or table as
a complete expression.  Do not write &ldquo;You can set:&rdquo;; instead, write
&ldquo;You can set these variables:&rdquo;.  The former expression sounds cut off. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Editions, Dates and Versions</h5>

<p>Include edition numbers, version numbers, and dates in the
<code>@copying</code> text (for people reading the Texinfo file, and for the
legal copyright in the output files).  Then use <code>@insertcopying</code>
in the <code>@titlepage</code> section (for people reading the printed
output) and the Top node (for people reading the online output).

  <p>It is easiest to do this using <code>@set</code> and <code>@value</code>. 
See <a href="value-Example.html#value-Example"><code>@value</code> Example</a>, and <a href="GNU-Sample-Texts.html#GNU-Sample-Texts">GNU Sample Texts</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Definition Commands</h5>

<p>Definition commands are <code>@deffn</code>, <code>@defun</code>,
<code>@defmac</code>, and the like, and enable you to write descriptions in
a uniform format.

     <ul>
<li>Write just one definition command for each entity you define with a
definition command.  The automatic indexing feature creates an index
entry that leads the reader to the definition.

     <li>Use <code>@table</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>@end table</code> in an appendix that
contains a summary of functions, not <code>@deffn</code> or other definition
commands. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Capitalization</h5>

     <ul>
<li>Capitalize &ldquo;Texinfo&rdquo;; it is a name.  Do not write the `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>' in upper case.

     <li>Capitalize &ldquo;Info&rdquo;; it is a name.

     <li>Write TeX using the <code>@TeX{}</code> command.  Note the uppercase
`<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>'.  This command causes the formatters to
typeset the name according to the wishes of Donald Knuth, who wrote
TeX. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Spaces</h5>

<p>Do not use spaces to format a Texinfo file, except inside of
<code>@example</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>@end example</code> and other literal
environments and commands.

  <p>For example, TeX fills the following:

<pre class="example">        @kbd{C-x v}
        @kbd{M-x vc-next-action}
           Perform the next logical operation
           on the version-controlled file
           corresponding to the current buffer.
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">so it looks like this:

  <blockquote>
`C-x v' `M-x vc-next-action' Perform the next logical operation on the
version-controlled file corresponding to the current buffer. 
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">In this case, the text should be formatted with
<code>@table</code>, <code>@item</code>, and <code>@itemx</code>, to create a table.

<h5 class="subsubheading">@code, @samp, @var, and `<samp><span class="samp">---</span></samp>'</h5>

     <ul>
<li>Use <code>@code</code> around Lisp symbols, including command names. 
For example,

     <pre class="example">          The main function is @code{vc-next-action}, ...
     </pre>
     <li>Avoid putting letters such as `<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' immediately after an
`<samp><span class="samp">@code</span></samp>'.  Such letters look bad.

     <li>Use <code>@var</code> around meta-variables.  Do not write angle brackets
around them.

     <li>Use three hyphens in a row, `<samp><span class="samp">---</span></samp>', to indicate a long dash.  TeX
typesets these as a long dash and the Info formatters reduce three
hyphens to two. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Periods Outside of Quotes</h5>

<p>Place periods and other punctuation marks <em>outside</em> of quotations,
unless the punctuation is part of the quotation.  This practice goes
against publishing conventions in the United States, but enables the
reader to distinguish between the contents of the quotation and the
whole passage.

  <p>For example, you should write the following sentence with the period
outside the end quotation marks:

<pre class="example">     Evidently, `<samp><span class="samp">au</span></samp>' is an abbreviation for ``author''.
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">since `<samp><span class="samp">au</span></samp>' does <em>not</em> serve as an  abbreviation for
`<samp><span class="samp">author.</span></samp>' (with a period following the word).

<h5 class="subsubheading">Introducing New Terms</h5>

     <ul>
<li>Introduce new terms so that a reader who does not know them can
understand them from context; or write a definition for the term.

     <p>For example, in the following, the terms &ldquo;check in&rdquo;, &ldquo;register&rdquo; and
&ldquo;delta&rdquo; are all appearing for the first time; the example sentence should be
rewritten so they are understandable.

     <blockquote>
The major function assists you in checking in a file to your
version control system and registering successive sets of changes to
it as deltas. 
</blockquote>

     <li>Use the <code>@dfn</code> command around a word being introduced, to indicate
that the reader should not expect to know the meaning already, and
should expect to learn the meaning from this passage. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">@pxref</h5>

<!-- !!! maybe include this in the tips on pxref -->
<p>Absolutely never use <code>@pxref</code> except in the special context for
which it is designed: inside parentheses, with the closing parenthesis
following immediately after the closing brace.  One formatter
automatically inserts closing punctuation and the other does not.  This
means that the output looks right both in printed output and in an Info
file, but only when the command is used inside parentheses.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Invoking from a Shell</h5>

<p>You can invoke programs such as Emacs, GCC, and <code>gawk</code> from a
shell.  The documentation for each program should contain a section that
describes this.  Unfortunately, if the node names and titles for these
sections are all different, they are difficult for users to find.

  <p>So, there is a convention to name such sections with a phrase beginning
with the word `Invoking', as in `Invoking Emacs'; this way, users can
find the section easily.

<h5 class="subsubheading">ANSI C Syntax</h5>

<p>When you use <code>@example</code> to describe a C function's calling
conventions, use the ANSI C syntax, like this:

<pre class="example">     void dld_init (char *@var{path});
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">And in the subsequent discussion, refer to the argument values by
writing the same argument names, again highlighted with
<code>@var</code>.

  <p>Avoid the obsolete style that looks like this:

<pre class="example">     #include &lt;dld.h&gt;
     
     dld_init (path)
     char *path;
</pre>
  <p>Also, it is best to avoid writing <code>#include</code> above the
declaration just to indicate that the function is declared in a
header file.  The practice may give the misimpression that the
<code>#include</code> belongs near the declaration of the function.  Either
state explicitly which header file holds the declaration or, better
yet, name the header file used for a group of functions at the
beginning of the section that describes the functions.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Bad Examples</h5>

<p>Here are several examples of bad writing to avoid:

  <p>In this example, say, &ldquo; <small class="dots">...</small> you must <code>@dfn</code>{check
in} the new version.&rdquo;  That flows better.

  <blockquote>
When you are done editing the file, you must perform a
<code>@dfn</code>{check in}. 
</blockquote>

  <p>In the following example, say, &ldquo;<small class="dots">...</small> makes a unified interface such as VC
mode possible.&rdquo;

  <blockquote>
SCCS, RCS and other version-control systems all perform similar
functions in broadly similar ways (it is this resemblance which makes
a unified control mode like this possible). 
</blockquote>

  <p>And in this example, you should specify what `it' refers to:

  <blockquote>
If you are working with other people, it assists in coordinating
everyone's changes so they do not step on each other. 
</blockquote>

<h5 class="subsubheading">And Finally <small class="dots">...</small></h5>

     <ul>
<li>Pronounce TeX as if the `<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>' were a Greek `chi', as the last
sound in the name `Bach'.  But pronounce Texinfo as in `speck':
&ldquo;teckinfo&rdquo;.

     <li>Write notes for yourself at the very end of a Texinfo file after the
<code>@bye</code>.  None of the formatters process text after the
<code>@bye</code>; it is as if the text were within <code>@ignore</code> <small class="dots">...</small>
<code>@end ignore</code>. 
</ul>
