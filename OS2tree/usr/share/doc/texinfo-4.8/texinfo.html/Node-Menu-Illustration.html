<h3 class="section">6.2 Node and Menu Illustration</h3>

<p>Here is a copy of the diagram shown earlier that illustrates a Texinfo
file with three chapters, each of which contains two sections.

  <p>The &ldquo;root&rdquo; is at the top of the diagram and the &ldquo;leaves&rdquo; are at the
bottom.  This is how such a diagram is drawn conventionally; it
illustrates an upside-down tree.  For this reason, the root node is
called the `Top' node, and `Up' node pointers carry you closer to the
root.

<pre class="example">                              Top
                               |
             -------------------------------------
            |                  |                  |
         Chapter 1          Chapter 2          Chapter 3
            |                  |                  |
         --------           --------           --------
        |        |         |        |         |        |
     Section  Section   Section  Section   Section  Section
       1.1      1.2       2.1      2.2       3.1      3.2
</pre>
  <p>The fully-written command to start Chapter 2 would be this:

<pre class="example">     @node     Chapter 2,  Chapter 3, Chapter 1, Top
     @comment  node-name,  next,      previous,  up
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">This <code>@node</code> line says that the name of this node is &ldquo;Chapter
2&rdquo;, the name of the `Next' node is &ldquo;Chapter 3&rdquo;, the name of the
`Previous' node is &ldquo;Chapter 1&rdquo;, and the name of the `Up' node is
&ldquo;Top&rdquo;.  You can omit writing out these node names if your document is
hierarchically organized (see <a href="makeinfo-Pointer-Creation.html#makeinfo-Pointer-Creation">makeinfo Pointer Creation</a>), but the
pointer relationships still obtain.

  <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> <strong>Please Note:</strong> `Next' refers to the next node at the same
hierarchical level in the manual, not necessarily to the next node
within the Texinfo file.  In the Texinfo file, the subsequent node may
be at a lower level&mdash;a section-level node most often follows a
chapter-level node, for example.  `Next' and `Previous' refer to nodes
at the <em>same</em> hierarchical level.  (The `Top' node contains the
exception to this rule.  Since the `Top' node is the only node at that
level, `Next' refers to the first following node, which is almost always
a chapter or chapter-level node.) 
</blockquote>

  <p>To go to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 using Info, you need a menu inside Chapter
2.  (See <a href="Menus.html#Menus">Menus</a>.)  You would write the menu just
before the beginning of Section 2.1, like this:

<pre class="example">        @menu
        * Sect. 2.1::    Description of this section.
        * Sect. 2.2::
        @end menu
</pre>
  <p>Write the node for Sect. 2.1 like this:

<pre class="example">        @node     Sect. 2.1, Sect. 2.2, Chapter 2, Chapter 2
        @comment  node-name, next,      previous,  up
</pre>
  <p>In Info format, the `Next' and `Previous' pointers of a node usually
lead to other nodes at the same level&mdash;from chapter to chapter or from
section to section (sometimes, as shown, the `Previous' pointer points
up); an `Up' pointer usually leads to a node at the level above (closer
to the `Top' node); and a `Menu' leads to nodes at a level below (closer
to `leaves').  (A cross reference can point to a node at any level;
see <a href="Cross-References.html#Cross-References">Cross References</a>.)

  <p>Usually, an <code>@node</code> command and a chapter structuring command are
used in sequence, along with indexing commands.  (You may follow the
<code>@node</code> line with a comment line that reminds you which pointer is
which.)

  <p>Here is the beginning of the chapter in this manual called &ldquo;Ending a
Texinfo File&rdquo;.  This shows an <code>@node</code> line followed by a comment
line, an <code>@chapter</code> line, and then by indexing lines.

<pre class="example">     @node    Ending a File, Structuring, Beginning a File, Top
     @comment node-name,     next,        previous,         up
     @chapter Ending a Texinfo File
     @cindex Ending a Texinfo file
     @cindex Texinfo file ending
     @cindex File ending
</pre>
  </body></html>
