<h4 class="subsection">22.4.1 HTML Cross-reference Link Basics</h4>

<p><a name="index-HTML-cross_002dreference-link-basics-1233"></a>
For our purposes, an HTML link consists of four components: a host
name, a directory part, a file part, and a target part.  We
always assume the <code>http</code> protocol.  For example:

<pre class="example">     http://<var>host</var>/<var>dir</var>/<var>file</var>.html#<var>target</var>
</pre>
  <p>The information to construct a link comes from the node name and
manual name in the cross-reference command in the Texinfo source
(see <a href="Cross-References.html#Cross-References">Cross References</a>), and from <dfn>external information</dfn>, which
is currently simply hardwired.  In the future, it may come from an
external data file.

  <p>We now consider each part in turn.

  <p>The <var>host</var> is hardwired to be the local host.  This could either
be the literal string `<samp><span class="samp">localhost</span></samp>', or, according to the rules for
HTML links, the `<samp><span class="samp">http://localhost/</span></samp>' could be omitted entirely.

  <p>The <var>dir</var> and <var>file</var> parts are more complicated, and depend on
the relative split/mono nature of both the manual being processed and
the manual that the cross-reference refers to.  The underlying idea is
that there is one directory for Texinfo manuals in HTML, and each
manual is either available as a monolithic file <samp><span class="file">manual.html</span></samp>, or a
split subdirectory <samp><span class="file">manual/*.html</span></samp>.  Here are the cases:

     <ul>
<li>If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is also split,
the directory is `<samp><span class="samp">../</span><var>referent/</var></samp>' and the file is the
expanded node name (described later).

     <li>If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is mono, the
directory is `<samp><span class="samp">../</span></samp>' and the file is <samp><var>referent</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>.

     <li>If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is split, the
directory is <samp><var>referent</var><span class="file">/</span></samp> and the file is the expanded node
name.

     <li>If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is also mono,
the directory is <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp> (or just the empty string), and the file is
<samp><var>referent</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>.

  </ul>

  <p>One exception: the algorithm for node name expansion prefixes the
string `<samp><span class="samp">g_t</span></samp>' when the node name begins with a non-letter.  This
kludge (due to XHTML rules) is not necessary for filenames, and is
therefore omitted.

  <p>Any directory part in the filename argument of the source
cross-reference command is ignored.  Thus, <code>@xref{,,,../foo}</code>
and <code>@xref{,,,foo}</code> both use `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' as the manual name. 
This is because any such attempted hardwiring of the directory is very
unlikely to be useful for both Info and HTML output.

  <p>Finally, the <var>target</var> part is always the expanded node name.

  <p>Whether the present manual is split or mono is determined by user
option; <samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> defaults to split, with the
<samp><span class="option">--no-split</span></samp> option overriding this.

  <p>Whether the referent manual is split or mono is another bit of the
external information.  For now, <samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> simply assumes the
referent manual is the same as the present manual.

  <p>There can be a mismatch between the format of the referent manual that
the generating software assumes, and the format it's actually present
in.  See <a href="HTML-Xref-Mismatch.html#HTML-Xref-Mismatch">HTML Xref Mismatch</a>.
