<h4 class="subsection">21.1.4 Pointer Validation</h4>

<p><a name="index-Pointer-validation-with-_0040code_007bmakeinfo_007d-1150"></a><a name="index-Validation-of-pointers-1151"></a>
If you do not suppress pointer validation with the `<samp><span class="samp">--no-validate</span></samp>'
option or the <code>@novalidate</code> command in the source file (see <a href="Use-TeX.html#Use-TeX">Use TeX</a>), <code>makeinfo</code> will check the validity of the final
Info file.  Mostly, this means ensuring that nodes you have referenced
really exist.  Here is a complete list of what is checked:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If a `Next', `Previous', or `Up' node reference is a reference to a
node in the current file and is not an external reference such as to
<samp><span class="file">(dir)</span></samp>, then the referenced node must exist.

     <li>In every node, if the `Previous' node is different from the `Up' node,
then the node pointed to by the `Previous' field must have a `Next'
field which points back to this node.

     <li>Every node except the `Top' node must have an `Up' pointer.

     <li>The node referenced by an `Up' pointer must itself reference the current
node through a menu item, unless the node referenced by `Up'
has the form `(<var>file</var>)'.

     <li>If the `Next' reference of a node is not the same as the `Next' reference
of the `Up' reference, then the node referenced by the `Next' pointer
must have a `Previous' pointer that points back to the current node. 
This rule allows the last node in a section to point to the first node
of the next chapter.

     <li>Every node except `Top' should be referenced by at least one other node,
either via the `Previous' or `Next' links, or via a menu or a
cross-reference.
       </ol>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040_0040_002dcommands-in-_0040_0040node_002c-limited-support-1152"></a>Some Texinfo documents might fail during the validation phase because
they use commands like <code>@value</code> and <code>@definfoenclose</code> in
node definitions and cross-references inconsistently.  (Your best bet
is to avoid using @-commands in node names.)  Consider the
following example:

<pre class="example">     @set nodename Node 1
     
     @node @value{nodename}, Node 2, Top, Top
     
     This is node 1.
     
     @node Node 2, , Node 1, Top
     
     This is node 2.
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">Here, the node &ldquo;Node 1&rdquo; was referenced both verbatim and through
<code>@value</code>.

  <p>By default, <code>makeinfo</code> fails such cases, because node names are not
fully expanded until they are written to the output file.  You should
always try to reference nodes consistently; e.g., in the above example,
the second <code>@node</code> line should have also used <code>@value</code>. 
However, if, for some reason, you <em>must</em> reference node names
inconsistently, and <code>makeinfo</code> fails to validate the file, you can
use the `<samp><span class="samp">--commands-in-node-names</span></samp>' option to force <code>makeinfo</code>
to perform the expensive expansion of all node names it finds in the
document.  This might considerably slow down the program, though;
twofold increase in conversion time was measured for large documents
such as the Jargon file.

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040_0040value-in-_0040_0040node-lines-1153"></a>The support for <code>@</code>-commands in <code>@node</code> directives is not
general enough to be freely used.  For example, if the example above
redefined <code>nodename</code> somewhere in the document, <code>makeinfo</code>
will fail to convert it, even if invoked with the
`<samp><span class="samp">--commands-in-node-names</span></samp>' option.

  <p>`<samp><span class="samp">--commands-in-node-names</span></samp>' has no effect if the `<samp><span class="samp">--no-validate</span></samp>'
option is given.
