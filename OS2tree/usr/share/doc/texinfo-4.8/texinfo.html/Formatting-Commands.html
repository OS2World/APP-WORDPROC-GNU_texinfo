<h3 class="section">1.6 @-commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040_0040_002dcommands-47"></a><a name="index-Formatting-commands-48"></a>
In a Texinfo file, the commands that tell TeX how to typeset the
printed manual and tell <code>makeinfo</code> and
<code>texinfo-format-buffer</code> how to create an Info file are preceded
by `<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>'; they are called <dfn>@-commands</dfn>.  For example,
<code>@node</code> is the command to indicate a node and <code>@chapter</code>
is the command to indicate the start of a chapter.

  <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Almost all @ command names are entirely lower case. 
</blockquote>

  <p>The Texinfo @-commands are a strictly limited set of constructs.  The
strict limits make it possible for Texinfo files to be understood both
by TeX and by the code that converts them into Info files.  You can
display Info files on any terminal that displays alphabetic and
numeric characters.  Similarly, you can print the output generated by
TeX on a wide variety of printers.

  <p>Depending on what they do or what arguments<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> they take, you
need to write @-commands on lines of their own or as part of
sentences:

     <ul>
<li>Write a command such as <code>@quotation</code> at the beginning of a line as
the only text on the line.  (<code>@quotation</code> begins an indented
environment.)

     <li>Write a command such as <code>@chapter</code> at the beginning of a line
followed by the command's arguments, in this case the chapter title, on
the rest of the line.  (<code>@chapter</code> creates chapter titles.)

     <li>Write a command such as <code>@dots{}</code> wherever you wish but usually
within a sentence. (<code>@dots{}</code> creates dots <small class="dots">...</small>)

     <li>Write a command such as <code>@code{</code><var>sample-code</var><code>}</code> wherever you
wish (but usually within a sentence) with its argument,
<var>sample-code</var> in this example, between the braces.  (<code>@code</code>
marks text as being code.)

     <li>Write a command such as <code>@example</code> on a line of its own; write the
body-text on following lines; and write the matching <code>@end</code>
command, <code>@end example</code> in this case, on a line of its own
after the body-text. (<code>@example</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>@end example</code>
indents and typesets body-text as an example.)  It's usually ok to
indent environment commands like this, but in complicated and
hard-to-define circumstances the extra spaces cause extra space to
appear in the output, so beware. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-Braces_002c-when-to-use-49"></a>As a general rule, a command requires braces if it mingles among other
text; but it does not need braces if it starts a line of its own.  The
non-alphabetic commands, such as <code>@:</code>, are exceptions to the rule;
they do not need braces.

  <p>As you gain experience with Texinfo, you will rapidly learn how to
write the different commands: the different ways to write commands
actually make it easier to write and read Texinfo files than if all
commands followed exactly the same syntax.  See <a href="Command-Syntax.html#Command-Syntax">@-Command Syntax</a>, for all the details.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The word
<dfn>argument</dfn> comes from the way it is used in mathematics and does not
refer to a dispute between two people; it refers to the information
presented to the command.  According to the <cite>Oxford English
Dictionary</cite>, the word derives from the Latin for <dfn>to make clear,
prove</dfn>; thus it came to mean `the evidence offered as proof', which is
to say, `the information offered', which led to its mathematical
meaning.  In its other thread of derivation, the word came to mean `to
assert in a manner against which others may make counter assertions',
which led to the meaning of `argument' as a dispute.</p>
