<h3 class="section">5.12 <code>@raisesections</code> and <code>@lowersections</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-raisesections-295"></a><a name="index-lowersections-296"></a><a name="index-Raising-and-lowering-sections-297"></a><a name="index-Lowering-and-raising-sections-298"></a><a name="index-Sections_002c-raising-and-lowering-299"></a>
The <code>@raisesections</code> and <code>@lowersections</code> commands
implicitly raise and lower the hierarchical level of following
chapters, sections and the other sectioning commands.

  <p>That is, the <code>@raisesections</code> command changes sections to
chapters, subsections to sections, and so on.  Conversely, the
<code>@lowersections</code> command changes chapters to sections, sections
to subsections, and so on.  Thus, an <code>@lowersections</code> command
cancels an <code>@raisesections</code> command, and vice versa.

  <p><a name="index-Include-files_002c-and-section-levels-300"></a>You can use <code>@lowersections</code> to include text written as an outer
or standalone Texinfo file in another Texinfo file as an inner,
included file.  Typical usage looks like this:

<pre class="example">     @lowersections
     @include somefile.texi
     @raisesections
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">(Without the <code>@raisesections</code>, all the subsequent
sections in the document would be lowered.)

  <p>If the included file being lowered has a <code>@top</code> node, you'll
need to conditionalize its inclusion with a flag (see <a href="set-value.html#set-value">set value</a>).

  <p>Another difficulty can arise with documents that use the (recommended)
feature of <samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> for implicitly determining node
pointers.  Since <samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> must assume a hierarchically
organized document to determine the pointers, you cannot just
arbitrarily sprinkle <code>@raisesections</code> and <code>@lowersections</code>
commands in the document.  The final result has to have menus that
take the raising and lowering into account.  Therefore, as a practical
matter, you generally only want to raise or lower large chunks,
usually in external files as shown above.

  <p>Repeated use of the commands continue to raise or lower the
hierarchical level a step at a time.  An attempt to raise above
`chapter' reproduces chapter commands; an attempt to lower below
`subsubsection' reproduces subsubsection commands.  Also, lowered
subsubsections and raised chapters will not work with
<samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp>'s feature of implicitly determining node pointers,
since the menu structure won't be correct.

  <p>Write each <code>@raisesections</code> and <code>@lowersections</code> command
on a line of its own.
