<h3 class="section">13.1 Making Index Entries</h3>

<p><a name="index-Index-entries_002c-making-600"></a><a name="index-Entries_002c-making-index-601"></a>
When you are making index entries, it is good practice to think of the
different ways people may look for something.  Different people
<em>do not</em> think of the same words when they look something up.  A
helpful index will have items indexed under all the different words
that people may use.  For example, one reader may think it obvious that
the two-letter names for indices should be listed under &ldquo;Indices,
two-letter names&rdquo;, since the word &ldquo;Index&rdquo; is the general concept. 
But another reader may remember the specific concept of two-letter
names and search for the entry listed as &ldquo;Two letter names for
indices&rdquo;.  A good index will have both entries and will help both
readers.

  <p>Like typesetting, the construction of an index is a highly skilled,
professional art, the subtleties of which are not appreciated until you
need to do it yourself.

  <p>See <a href="Printing-Indices-_0026-Menus.html#Printing-Indices-_0026-Menus">Printing Indices &amp; Menus</a>, for information about printing an index
at the end of a book or creating an index menu in an Info file.
