<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 <code>@copying</code>: Declare Copying Permissions</h4>

<p><a name="index-copying-181"></a>
The <code>@copying</code> command should be given very early in the document;
the recommended location is right after the header material
(see <a href="Texinfo-File-Header.html#Texinfo-File-Header">Texinfo File Header</a>).  It conventionally consists of a sentence
or two about what the program is, identification of the documentation
itself, the legal copyright line, and the copying permissions.  Here is
a skeletal example:

<pre class="example">     @copying
     This manual is for <var>program</var> (version <var>version</var>, updated
     <var>date</var>), which ...
     
     Copyright @copyright{} <var>years</var> <var>copyright-owner</var>.
     
     @quotation
     Permission is granted to ...
     @end quotation
     @end copying
</pre>
  <p>The <code>@quotation</code> has no legal significance; it's there to improve
readability in some contexts.

  <p>See <a href="GNU-Sample-Texts.html#GNU-Sample-Texts">GNU Sample Texts</a>, for the full text to be used in GNU manuals. 
See <a href="GNU-Free-Documentation-License.html#GNU-Free-Documentation-License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>, for the license itself under
which GNU and other free manuals are distributed.  You need to include
the license as an appendix to your document.

  <p>The text of <code>@copying</code> is output as a comment at the beginning of
Info, HTML, and XML output files.  It is <em>not</em> output implicitly in
plain text or TeX; it's up to you to use <code>@insertcopying</code> to
emit the copying information.  See the next section for details.

  <p><a name="index-copyright-182"></a>The <code>@copyright{}</code> command generates a `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>' inside a circle
in output formats that support this (print and HTML).  In the other
formats (Info and plain text), it generates `<samp><span class="samp">(C)</span></samp>'.  The copyright
notice itself has the following legally defined sequence:

<pre class="example">     Copyright &copy; <var>years</var> <var>copyright-owner</var>.
</pre>
  <p><a name="index-Copyright-word_002c-always-in-English-183"></a>The word `Copyright' must always be written in English, even if the
document is otherwise written in another language.  This is due to
international law.

  <p><a name="index-Years_002c-in-copyright-line-184"></a>The list of years should include all years in which a version was
completed (even if it was released in a subsequent year).  Ranges are
not allowed; each year must be written out individually and in full,
separated by commas.

  <p><a name="index-Copyright-holder-for-FSF-works-185"></a><a name="index-Holder-of-copyright-for-FSF-works-186"></a><a name="index-Owner-of-copyright-for-FSF-works-187"></a>The copyright owner (or owners) is whoever holds legal copyright on the
work.  In the case of works assigned to the FSF, the owner is `Free
Software Foundation, Inc.'.

  <p>The copyright `line' may actually be split across multiple
lines, both in the source document and in the output.  This often
happens for documents with a long history, having many different years
of publication.

  <p>See <a href="../maintain/Copyright-Notices.html#Copyright-Notices">Copyright Notices</a>, for
additional information.
