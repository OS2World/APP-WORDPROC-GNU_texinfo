<h3 class="section">19.3 Macro Details and Caveats</h3>

<p><a name="index-Macro-details-970"></a><a name="index-Details-of-macro-usage-971"></a><a name="index-Caveats-for-macro-usage-972"></a>
Due to unavoidable limitations, certain macro-related constructs cause
problems with TeX.  If you get macro-related errors when producing
the printed version of a manual, try expanding the macros with
<samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> by invoking <samp><span class="command">texi2dvi</span></samp> with the `<samp><span class="samp">-E</span></samp>'
option (see <a href="Format-with-texi2dvi.html#Format-with-texi2dvi">Format with texi2dvi</a>).

     <ul>
<li>As mentioned earlier, macro names must consist entirely of letters.

     <li>It is not advisable to redefine any TeX primitive, plain, or
Texinfo command name as a macro. Unfortunately this is a very large
set of names, and the possible resulting errors are unpredictable.

     <li>All macros are expanded inside at least one TeX group.  This means
that <code>@set</code> and other such commands have no effect inside a
macro.

     <li>Commas in macro arguments, even if escaped by a backslash, don't
always work.

     <li>Macro arguments cannot cross lines.

     <li>It is (usually) best to avoid comments inside macro definitions, but
see the next item.

     <li>Macros containing a command which must be on a line by itself, such as
a conditional, cannot be invoked in the middle of a line.  In general,
the interaction of newlines in the macro definitions and invocations
depends on the precise commands and context.  You may be able to work
around some problems with judicious use of <code>@c</code>.  Suppose you
define a macro that is always intended to be used on a line by itself:

     <pre class="example">          @macro linemac
          @cindex whatever
          @c
          @end macro
          ...
          foo
          @linemac
          bar
     </pre>
     <p>Without the <code>@c</code>, there will be an unwanted blank line between
the `<samp><span class="samp">@cindex whatever</span></samp>' and the `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>' (one newline comes
from the macro definition, one from after the invocation), causing a
paragraph break.

     <p>On the other hand, you wouldn't want the <code>@c</code> if the macro was
sometimes invoked in the middle of a line (the text after the
invocation would be treated as a comment).

     <li>In general, you can't arbitrarily substitute a macro call for Texinfo
command arguments, even when the text is the same.  It might work with
some commands, it fails with others.  Best not to do it at all.  For
instance, this fails:

     <pre class="example">          @macro offmacro
          off
          @end macro
          @headings @offmacro
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">You would expect this to be equivalent to <code>@headings off</code>, but
for TeXnical reasons, it fails with a mysterious error message
(<code>Paragraph ended before @headings was complete</code>).

     <li>Macros cannot define macros in the natural way.  To do this, you must
use conditionals and raw TeX.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          @ifnottex
          @macro ctor {name, arg}
          @macro \name\
          something involving \arg\ somehow
          @end macro
          @end macro
          @end ifnottex
          @tex
          \gdef\ctor#1{\ctorx#1,}
          \gdef\ctorx#1,#2,{\def#1{something involving #2 somehow}}
          @end tex
     </pre>
     </ul>

  <p>The <samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> implementation also has limitations:

     <ul>
<li><code>@verbatim</code> and macros do not mix; for instance, you can't start
a verbatim block inside a macro and end it outside. 
(See <a href="verbatim.html#verbatim">verbatim</a>.)  Starting any environment inside a macro and ending
it outside may or may not work, for that matter.

     <li>Macros that completely define macros are ok, but it's not possible to
have incorrectly nested macro definitions.  That is, <code>@macro</code>
and <code>@end macro</code> (likewise for <code>@rmacro</code>) must be
correctly paired.  For example, you cannot start a macro definition
within a macro, and then end the nested definition outside the macro.

     <li><code>@rmacro</code> is a kludge.

  </ul>

  <p>One more limitation is common to both implementations: white space is
ignored at the beginnings of lines.

  <p>Future major revisions of Texinfo may ease some of these limitations
(by introducing a new macro syntax).
