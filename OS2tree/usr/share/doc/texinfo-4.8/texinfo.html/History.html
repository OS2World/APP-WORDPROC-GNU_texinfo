<p><a name="index-Stallman_002c-Richard-M_002e-79"></a><a name="index-Chassell_002c-Robert-J_002e-80"></a><a name="index-Fox_002c-Brian-81"></a><a name="index-Berry_002c-Karl-82"></a>Richard M. Stallman invented the Texinfo format, wrote the initial
processors, and created Edition 1.0 of this manual.  Robert&nbsp;J.<!-- /@w -->
Chassell greatly revised and extended the manual, starting with Edition
1.1.  Brian Fox was responsible for the standalone Texinfo distribution
until version 3.8, and wrote the standalone <samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">info</span></samp> programs.  Karl Berry has continued maintenance since
Texinfo 3.8 (manual edition 2.22).

  <p><a name="index-Pinard_002c-Fran_0040_002c_007bc_007dois-83"></a><a name="index-Zuhn_002c-David-D_002e-84"></a><a name="index-Weisshaus_002c-Melissa-85"></a><a name="index-Zaretskii_002c-Eli-86"></a><a name="index-Schwab_002c-Andreas-87"></a><a name="index-Weinberg_002c-Zack-88"></a>Our thanks go out to all who helped improve this work, particularly the
indefatigable Eli Zaretskii and Andreas Schwab, who have provided
patches beyond counting.  Fran&ccedil;ois Pinard and David&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Zuhn<!-- /@w -->,
tirelessly recorded and reported mistakes and obscurities.  Zack
Weinberg did the impossible by implementing the macro syntax in
<samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp>.  Special thanks go to Melissa Weisshaus for her
frequent reviews of nearly similar editions.  Dozens of others have
contributed patches and suggestions, they are gratefully acknowledged in
the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file.  Our mistakes are our own.

  <p><a name="index-Scribe-89"></a><a name="index-Reid_002c-Brian-90"></a><a name="index-History-of-Texinfo-91"></a><a name="index-Texinfo-history-92"></a>A bit of history: in the 1970's at CMU, Brian Reid developed a program
and format named Scribe to mark up documents for printing.  It used the
<code>@</code> character to introduce commands, as Texinfo does.  Much more
consequentially, it strived to describe document contents rather than
formatting, an idea wholeheartedly adopted by Texinfo.

  <p><a name="index-Bolio-93"></a><a name="index-Bo_0040TeX_007b_007d-94"></a>Meanwhile, people at MIT developed another, not too dissimilar format
called Bolio.  This then was converted to using TeX as its typesetting
language: BoTeX.  The earliest BoTeX version seems to have been
0.02 on October 31, 1984.

  <p>BoTeX could only be used as a markup language for documents to be
printed, not for online documents.  Richard Stallman (RMS) worked on
both Bolio and BoTeX.  He also developed a nifty on-line help format
called Info, and then combined BoTeX and Info to create Texinfo, a
mark up language for text that is intended to be read both online and
as printed hard copy.
