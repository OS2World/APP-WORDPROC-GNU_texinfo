<h3 class="section">7.1 Parts of an Xref</h3>

<p>Cross references have two major parts: the first part is called the
<dfn>label</dfn>; it is the name that you can use to refer to the cross
reference, and the second is the <dfn>target</dfn>; it is the full name of
the node that the cross reference points to.

   <p>The target is separated from the label by a colon `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>'; first the
label appears, and then the target.  For example, in the sample menu
cross reference below, the single colon separates the label from the
target.

<pre class="example">     * Foo Label: Foo Target.        More information about Foo.
</pre>
   <p>Note the `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' which ends the name of the target.  The `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' is
not part of the target; it serves only to let Info know where the target
name ends.

   <p>A shorthand way of specifying references allows two adjacent colons to
stand for a target name which is the same as the label name:

<pre class="example">     * Foo Commands::                Commands pertaining to Foo.
</pre>
   <p>In the above example, the name of the target is the same as the name of
the label, in this case <code>Foo Commands</code>.

   <p>You will normally see two types of cross reference while viewing nodes:
<dfn>menu</dfn> references, and <dfn>note</dfn> references.  Menu references
appear within a node's menu; they begin with a `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' at the beginning
of a line, and continue with a label, a target, and a comment which
describes what the contents of the node pointed to contains.

   <p>Note references appear within the body of the node text; they begin with
<code>*Note</code>, and continue with a label and a target.

   <p>Like `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' pointers, cross references
can point to any valid node.  They are used to refer you to a place
where more detailed information can be found on a particular subject. 
Here is a cross reference which points to a node within the Texinfo
documentation:  See <a href="../texinfo/xref.html#xref">Writing an Xref</a>, for more information on creating your own texinfo cross
references.
