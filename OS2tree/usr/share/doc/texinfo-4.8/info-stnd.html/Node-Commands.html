<h2 class="chapter">5 Selecting a Node</h2>

<p><a name="index-nodes_002c-selection-of-121"></a>
This section details the numerous Info commands which select a new node
to view in the current window.

   <p>The most basic node commands are `<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>', and
`<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>'.  Note that the commands to select nodes are mapped differently
when `<samp><span class="samp">--vi-keys</span></samp>' is in effect; these keybindings are designated
below as &ldquo;vi-like operation&rdquo;.

   <p>When you are viewing a node, the top line of the node contains some Info
<dfn>pointers</dfn> which describe where the next, previous, and up nodes
are.  Info uses this line to move about the node structure of the file
when you use the following commands:

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;n&gt; (<code>next-node</code>)<dt><kbd>C-&lt;NEXT&gt;</kbd> (on DOS/Windows only)<dt><kbd>C-x &lt;n&gt;</kbd>, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-n-122"></a><a name="index-C_002dNEXT-123"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-n_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-124"></a><a name="index-next_002dnode-125"></a>Select the `Next' node.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dPgDn-126"></a>The &lt;NEXT&gt; key is known as the &lt;PgDn&gt; key on some
keyboards.

     <br><dt>&lt;p&gt; (<code>prev-node</code>)<dt><kbd>C-&lt;PREVIOUS&gt;</kbd> (on DOS/Windows only)<dd><a name="index-p-127"></a><a name="index-C_002dPREVIOUS-128"></a><a name="index-prev_002dnode-129"></a>Select the `Prev' node.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dPgUp-130"></a>The &lt;PREVIOUS&gt; key is known as the &lt;PgUp&gt; key on some
keyboards.

     <br><dt>&lt;u&gt; (<code>up-node</code>)<dt><kbd>C-&lt;UP&gt;</kbd> (an arrow key on DOS/Windows only)<dt><kbd>C-x &lt;u&gt;</kbd>, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-u-131"></a><a name="index-C_002dUP-132"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-u_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-133"></a><a name="index-up_002dnode-134"></a>Select the `Up' node. 
</dl>

   <p>You can easily select a node that you have already viewed in this window
by using the `<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>' command&mdash;this name stands for &ldquo;last&rdquo;, and
actually moves backwards through the history of visited nodes for this
window.  This is handy when you followed a reference to another node,
possibly to read about a related issue, and would like then to resume
reading at the same place where you started the excursion.

   <p>Each node where you press `<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>' is discarded from the history.  Thus,
by the time you get to the first node you visited in a window, the
entire history of that window is discarded.

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;l&gt; (<code>history-node</code>)<dt>&lt;C-&lt;CENTER&gt;&gt; (on DOS/Windows only)<dt>&lt;'&gt;, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-l-135"></a><a name="index-C_002dCENTER-136"></a><a name="index-g_t_0027_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-137"></a><a name="index-history_002dnode-138"></a>Pop the most recently selected node in this window from the node
history. 
</dl>

   <p>Two additional commands make it easy to select the most commonly
selected nodes; they are `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>'.

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;t&gt; (<code>top-node</code>)<dt>&lt;M-t&gt;, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-t-139"></a><a name="index-M_002dt_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-140"></a><a name="index-top_002dnode-141"></a>Select the node `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>' in the current Info file.

     <br><dt>&lt;d&gt; (<code>dir-node</code>)<dt>&lt;M-d&gt;, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-d-142"></a><a name="index-M_002dd_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-143"></a><a name="index-dir_002dnode-144"></a>Select the directory node (i.e., the node `<samp><span class="samp">(dir)</span></samp>'). 
</dl>

   <p>Here are some other commands which immediately result in the selection
of a different node in the current window:

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;&lt;&gt; (<code>first-node</code>)<dt>&lt;g&gt;, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-g_t_003c-145"></a><a name="index-g_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-146"></a><a name="index-first_002dnode-147"></a>Selects the first node which appears in this file.  This node is most
often `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>', but it does not have to be.  With a numeric argument
<var>N</var>, select the <var>N</var>th node (the first node is node 1).  An
argument of zero is the same as the argument of 1.

     <br><dt>&lt;&gt;&gt; (<code>last-node</code>)<dt>&lt;G&gt;, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-g_t_003e-148"></a><a name="index-G_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-149"></a><a name="index-last_002dnode-150"></a>Select the last node which appears in this file.  With a numeric argument
<var>N</var>, select the <var>N</var>th node (the first node is node 1).  An
argument of zero is the same as no argument, i.e., it selects the last
node.

     <br><dt>&lt;]&gt; (<code>global-next-node</code>)<dd><a name="index-g_t_005d-151"></a><a name="index-global_002dnext_002dnode-152"></a>Move forward or down through node structure.  If the node that you are
currently viewing has a `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' pointer, that node is selected. 
Otherwise, if this node has a menu, the first menu item is selected.  If
there is no `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' and no menu, the same process is tried with the
`<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' node of this node.

     <br><dt>&lt;[&gt; (<code>global-prev-node</code>)<dd><a name="index-g_t_005b-153"></a><a name="index-global_002dprev_002dnode-154"></a>Move backward or up through node structure.  If the node that you are
currently viewing has a `<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>' pointer, that node is selected. 
Otherwise, if the node has an `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' pointer, that node is selected,
and if it has a menu, the last item in the menu is selected. 
</dl>

   <p>You can get the same behavior as <code>global-next-node</code> and
<code>global-prev-node</code> while simply scrolling through the file with
&lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;; See <a href="Variables.html#Variables"><code>scroll-behavior</code></a>, for
more information.

     <dl>
<a name="goto_002dnode"></a>
<dt>&lt;g&gt; (<code>goto-node</code>)<dt><kbd>C-x &lt;g&gt;</kbd>, vi-like operation<dd><a name="index-g-155"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-g_002c-vi_002dlike-operation-156"></a><a name="index-goto_002dnode-157"></a>Read the name of a node and select it.  While reading the node name,
completion (see <a href="The-Echo-Area.html#The-Echo-Area">completion</a>) is only done for the
nodes which reside in one of the Info files that were loaded in the
current Info session; if the desired node resides in some other file,
you must type the node exactly as it appears in that Info file, and you
must include the Info file of the other file.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          <code>g(emacs)Buffers</code>
     </pre>
     <p>finds the node `<samp><span class="samp">Buffers</span></samp>' in the Info file <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp>.

     <p><a name="goto_002dinvocation"></a>
<br><dt>&lt;O&gt; (<code>goto-invocation</code><dt>&lt;I&gt;<dd><a name="index-O-158"></a><a name="index-I-159"></a><a name="index-goto_002dinvocation-160"></a><a name="index-finding-the-Invocation-node-161"></a>Read the name of a program and look for a node in the current Info file
which describes the invocation and the command-line options for that
program.  The default program name is derived from the name of the
current Info file.  This command does the same as the
`<samp><span class="samp">--show-options</span></samp>' command-line option (see <a href="_002d_002dshow_002doptions.html#g_t_002d_002dshow_002doptions">&ndash;show-options</a>), but
it also allows to specify the program name; this is important for those
manuals which describe several programs.

     <p>If you need to find the Invocation node of a program that is documented
in another Info file, you need to visit that file before invoking
`<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>'.  For example, if you are reading the Emacs manual and want to
see the command-line options of the <code>makeinfo</code> program, type <kbd>g
(texinfo) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> and then <kbd>I makeinfo &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  If you don't
know what Info file documents the command, or if invoking `<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>'
doesn't display the right node, go to the `<samp><span class="samp">(dir)</span></samp>' node (using the
`<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>' command) and invoke `<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>' from there.

     <br><dt>&lt;G&gt; (<code>menu-sequence</code>)<dd><a name="index-G-162"></a><a name="index-menu_002dsequence-163"></a><a name="index-menu_002c-following_002c-from-inside-Info-164"></a>Read a sequence of menu entries and follow it.  Info prompts for a
sequence of menu items separated by commas.  (Since commas are not
allowed in a node name, they are a natural choice for a delimiter in a
list of menu items.)  Info then looks up the first item in the menu of
the node `<samp><span class="samp">(dir)</span></samp>' (if the `<samp><span class="samp">(dir)</span></samp>' node cannot be found, Info
uses `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>').  If such an entry is found, Info goes to the node it
points to and looks up the second item in the menu of that node, etc. 
In other words, you can specify a complete path which descends through
the menu hierarchy of a particular Info file starting at the
`<samp><span class="samp">(dir)</span></samp>' node.  This has the same effect as if you typed the menu
item sequence on Info's command line, see <a href="command_002dline-menu-items.html#command_002dline-menu-items">Info command-line arguments processing</a>.  For example,

     <pre class="example">           <kbd>G Texinfo,Overview,Reporting Bugs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">displays the node `<samp><span class="samp">Reporting Bugs</span></samp>' in the Texinfo manual.  (You
don't actually need to type the menu items in their full length, or in
their exact letter-case.  However, if you do type the menu items
exactly, Info will find it faster.)

     <p>If any of the menu items you type are not found, Info stops at the last
entry it did find and reports an error.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;k&gt;</kbd> (<code>kill-node</code>)<dd><a name="index-C_002dx-k-165"></a><a name="index-kill_002dnode-166"></a>Kill a node.  The node name is prompted for in the echo area, with a
default of the current node.  <dfn>Killing</dfn> a node means that Info tries
hard to forget about it, removing it from the list of history nodes kept
for the window where that node is found.  Another node is selected in
the window which contained the killed node.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>view-file</code>)<dd><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002df-167"></a><a name="index-view_002dfile-168"></a>Read the name of a file and selects the entire file.  The command
     <pre class="example">          <code>C-x C-f </code><var>filename</var>
     </pre>
     <p>is equivalent to typing
     <pre class="example">          <code>g(</code><var>filename</var><code>)*</code>
     </pre>
     <br><dt><kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> (<code>list-visited-nodes</code>)<dd><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002db-169"></a><a name="index-list_002dvisited_002dnodes-170"></a>Make a window containing a menu of all of the currently visited nodes. 
This window becomes the selected window, and you may use the standard
Info commands within it.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;b&gt;</kbd> (<code>select-visited-node</code>)<dd><a name="index-C_002dx-b-171"></a><a name="index-select_002dvisited_002dnode-172"></a>Select a node which has been previously visited in a visible window. 
This is similar to `<samp><span class="samp">C-x C-b</span></samp>' followed by `<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>', but no window is
created.
