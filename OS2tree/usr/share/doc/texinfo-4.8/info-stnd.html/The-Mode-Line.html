<h3 class="section">8.1 The Mode Line</h3>

<p>A <dfn>mode line</dfn> is a line of inverse video which appears at the bottom
of an Info window.  It describes the contents of the window just above
it; this information includes the name of the file and node appearing in
that window, the number of screen lines it takes to display the node,
and the percentage of text that is above the top of the window.  It can
also tell you if the indirect tags table for this Info file needs to be
updated, and whether or not the Info file was compressed when stored on
disk.

   <p>Here is a sample mode line for a window containing an uncompressed file
named <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp>, showing the node `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>'.

<pre class="example">     -----Info: (dir)Top, 40 lines --Top-------------------------------------
                 ^^   ^   ^^^        ^^
               (file)Node #lines    where
</pre>
   <p>When a node comes from a file which is compressed on disk, this is
indicated in the mode line with two small `<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>''s.  In addition, if
the Info file containing the node has been split into subfiles, the name
of the subfile containing the node appears in the modeline as well:

<pre class="example">     --zz-Info: (emacs)Top, 291 lines --Top-- Subfile: emacs-1.Z-------------
</pre>
   <p>Truncation of long lines (as opposed to wrapping them to the next
display line, see <a href="Scrolling-Commands.html#Scrolling-Commands">toggle-wrap</a>) is indicated by a
`<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' at the left edge of the mode line:

<pre class="example">     --$--Info: (texinfo)Top, 480 lines --Top-- Subfile: texinfo-1-----------
</pre>
   <p>When Info makes a node internally, such that there is no corresponding
info file on disk, the name of the node is surrounded by asterisks
(`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>').  The name itself tells you what the contents of the window
are; the sample mode line below shows an internally constructed node
showing possible completions:

<pre class="example">     -----Info: *Completions*, 7 lines --All---------------------------------
</pre>
   </body></html>
