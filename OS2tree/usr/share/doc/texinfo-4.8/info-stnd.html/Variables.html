<h2 class="chapter">11 Manipulating Variables</h2>

<p>GNU Info contains several <dfn>variables</dfn> whose values are looked at by
various Info commands.  You can change the values of these variables,
and thus change the behavior of Info to more closely match your
environment and Info file reading manner.

   <p>There are two ways to set the value of a variable: interactively, using
the <code>set-variable</code> command described below, or in the <code>#var</code>
section of the <code>.infokey</code> file.  See <a href="Custom-Key-Bindings.html#Custom-Key-Bindings">Custom Key Bindings</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x set-variable</kbd><dd><a name="index-variables_002c-setting-360"></a><a name="index-set_002dvariable-361"></a>Read the name of a variable, and the value for it, in the echo area and
then set the variable to that value.  Completion is available when
reading the variable name (see <a href="The-Echo-Area.html#The-Echo-Area">completion</a>); often,
completion is available when reading the value to give to the variable,
but that depends on the variable itself.  If a variable does <em>not</em>
supply multiple choices to complete over, it expects a numeric value.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x describe-variable</kbd><dd><a name="index-variables_002c-describing-362"></a><a name="index-describe_002dvariable-363"></a>Read the name of a variable in the echo area and then display a brief
description of what the variable affects. 
</dl>

   <p>Here is a list of the variables that you can set in Info.

     <dl>
<dt><code>automatic-footnotes</code><dd><a name="index-automatic_002dfootnotes-364"></a>When set to <code>On</code>, footnotes appear and disappear automatically;
else, they appear at the bottom of the node text.  This variable is
<code>Off</code> by default.  When a node is selected, a window containing
the footnotes which appear in that node is created, and the footnotes
are displayed within the new window.  The window that Info creates to
contain the footnotes is called `<samp><span class="samp">*Footnotes*</span></samp>'.  If a node is
selected which contains no footnotes, and a `<samp><span class="samp">*Footnotes*</span></samp>' window
is on the screen, the `<samp><span class="samp">*Footnotes*</span></samp>' window is deleted.  Footnote
windows created in this fashion are not automatically tiled so that
they can use as little of the display as is possible.

     <br><dt><code>automatic-tiling</code><dd><a name="index-automatic_002dtiling-365"></a>When set to <code>On</code>, creating or deleting a window resizes other
windows.  This variable is <code>Off</code> by default.  Normally, typing
`<samp><span class="samp">C-x 2</span></samp>' divides the current window into two equal parts.  When
<code>automatic-tiling</code> is set to <code>On</code>, all of the windows are
resized automatically, keeping an equal number of lines visible in each
window.  There are exceptions to the automatic tiling; specifically, the
windows `<samp><span class="samp">*Completions*</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">*Footnotes*</span></samp>' are <em>not</em>
resized through automatic tiling; they remain their original size.

     <br><dt><code>errors-ring-bell</code><dd><a name="index-errors_002dring_002dbell-366"></a>When set to <code>On</code>, errors cause the bell to ring.  The default
setting of this variable is <code>On</code>.

     <br><dt><code>gc-compressed-files</code><dd><a name="index-gc_002dcompressed_002dfiles-367"></a>When set to <code>On</code>, Info garbage collects files which had to be
uncompressed.  The default value of this variable is <code>Off</code>. 
Whenever a node is visited in Info, the Info file containing that node
is read into core, and Info reads information about the tags and nodes
contained in that file.  Once the tags information is read by Info, it
is never forgotten.  However, the actual text of the nodes does not need
to remain in core unless a particular Info window needs it.  For
non-compressed files, the text of the nodes does not remain in core when
it is no longer in use.  But de-compressing a file can be a time
consuming operation, and so Info tries hard not to do it twice. 
<code>gc-compressed-files</code> tells Info it is okay to garbage collect the
text of the nodes of a file which was compressed on disk.

     <br><dt><code>ISO-Latin</code><dd><a name="index-ISO-Latin-characters-368"></a><a name="index-ISO_002dLatin-369"></a>When set to <code>On</code>, Info accepts and displays ISO Latin characters. 
By default, Info assumes an ASCII character set.  <code>ISO-Latin</code> tells
Info that it is running in an environment where the European standard
character set is in use, and allows you to input such characters to
Info, as well as display them.

     <br><dt><code>scroll-behavior</code><dd><a name="index-scroll_002dbehavior-370"></a>Control what happens when forward scrolling is requested at the end of
a node, or when backward scrolling is requested at the beginning of a
node.  The default value for this variable is <code>Continuous</code>.  There
are three possible values for this variable:

          <dl>
<dt><code>Continuous</code><dd>Try to get the first item in this node's menu, or failing that, the
`<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' node, or failing that, the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' of the `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>'. 
This behavior is identical to using the `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'
(<code>global-next-node</code>) and `<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>' (<code>global-prev-node</code>)
commands.

          <br><dt><code>Next Only</code><dd>Only try to get the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' node.

          <br><dt><code>Page Only</code><dd>Simply give up, changing nothing.  If <code>scroll-behavior</code> is
<code>Page Only</code>, no scrolling command can change the node that is being
viewed. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>scroll-step</code><dd><a name="index-scroll_002dstep-371"></a>The number of lines to scroll when the cursor moves out of the window. 
Scrolling happens automatically if the cursor has moved out of the
visible portion of the node text when it is time to display.  Usually
the scrolling is done so as to put the cursor on the center line of the
current window.  However, if the variable <code>scroll-step</code> has a
nonzero value, Info attempts to scroll the node text by that many lines;
if that is enough to bring the cursor back into the window, that is what
is done.  The default value of this variable is 0, thus placing the
cursor (and the text it is attached to) in the center of the window. 
Setting this variable to 1 causes a kind of &ldquo;smooth scrolling&rdquo; which
some people prefer.

     <br><dt><code>show-index-match</code><dd><a name="index-show_002dindex_002dmatch-372"></a>When set to <code>On</code>, the portion of the matched search string is
highlighted in the message which explains where the matched search
string was found.  The default value of this variable is <code>On</code>. 
When Info displays the location where an index match was found,
(see <a href="Searching-Commands.html#Searching-Commands"><code>next-index-match</code></a>), the portion of the
string that you had typed is highlighted by displaying it in the inverse
case from its surrounding characters.

     <br><dt><code>visible-bell</code><dd><a name="index-visible_002dbell-373"></a>When set to <code>On</code>, GNU Info attempts to flash the screen instead of
ringing the bell.  This variable is <code>Off</code> by default.  Of course,
Info can only flash the screen if the terminal allows it; in the case
that the terminal does not allow it, the setting of this variable has no
effect.  However, you can make Info perform quietly by setting the
<code>errors-ring-bell</code> variable to <code>Off</code>.
