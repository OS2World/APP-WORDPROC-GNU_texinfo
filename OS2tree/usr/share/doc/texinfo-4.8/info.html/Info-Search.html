<h3 class="section">2.2 How to search Info documents for specific subjects</h3>

<p><a name="index-searching-Info-documents-59"></a><a name="index-Info-document-as-a-reference-60"></a>  The commands which move between and inside nodes allow you to read
the entire manual or its large portions.  But what if you need to find
some information in the manual as fast as you can, and you don't know
or don't remember in what node to look for it?  This need arises when
you use a manual as a <dfn>reference</dfn>, or when it is impractical to
read the entire manual before you start using the programs it
describes.

   <p>Info has powerful searching facilities that let you find things
quickly.  You can search either the manual indices or its text.

   <p><a name="index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-61"></a><a name="index-Info_002dindex-62"></a>  Since most subjects related to what the manual describes should be
indexed, you should try the index search first.  The <kbd>i</kbd> command
prompts you for a subject and then looks up that subject in the
indices.  If it finds an index entry with the subject you typed, it
goes to the node to which that index entry points.  You should browse
through that node to see whether the issue you are looking for is
described there.  If it isn't, type <kbd>,</kbd> one or more times to go
through additional index entries which match your subject.

   <p>The <kbd>i</kbd> command finds all index entries which include the string
you typed <em>as a substring</em>.  For each match, Info shows in the
echo area the full index entry it found.  Often, the text of the full
index entry already gives you enough information to decide whether it
is relevant to what you are looking for, so we recommend that you read
what Info shows in the echo area before looking at the node it
displays.

   <p>Since <kbd>i</kbd> looks for a substring, you can search for subjects even
if you are not sure how they are spelled in the index.  For example,
suppose you want to find something that is pertinent to commands which
complete partial input (e.g., when you type &lt;TAB&gt;).  If you want
to catch index entries that refer to &ldquo;complete&rdquo;, &ldquo;completion&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;completing&rdquo;, you could type <kbd>icomplet&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>Info documents which describe programs should index the commands,
options, and key sequences that the program provides.  If you are
looking for a description of a command, an option, or a key, just type
their names when <kbd>i</kbd> prompts you for a topic.  For example, if you
want to read the description of what the <kbd>C-f</kbd> key does, type
<kbd>i C - f &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  Here <kbd>C-f</kbd> are 3 literal characters
`<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>', not the &ldquo;Control-f&rdquo; command key
you type inside Emacs to run the command bound to <kbd>C-f</kbd>.

   <p>In Emacs, <kbd>i</kbd> runs the command <code>Info-index</code>.

   <p><a name="index-info_002dapropos-63"></a>If you don't know what manual documents something, try the <kbd>M-x
info-apropos</kbd> command.  It prompts for a string and then looks up that
string in all the indices of all the Info documents installed on your
system.

   <p><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-64"></a><a name="index-Info_002dsearch-65"></a>  The <kbd>s</kbd> command allows you to search a whole file for a string. 
It switches to the next node if and when that is necessary.  You
type <kbd>s</kbd> followed by the string to search for, terminated by
&lt;RET&gt;.  To search for the same string again, just <kbd>s</kbd> followed
by &lt;RET&gt; will do.  The file's nodes are scanned in the order
they are in in the file, which has no necessary relationship to the
order that they may be in the tree structure of menus and `<samp><span class="samp">next</span></samp>'
pointers.  But normally the two orders are not very different.  In any
case, you can always do a <kbd>b</kbd> to find out what node you have
reached, if the header is not visible (this can happen, because <kbd>s</kbd>
puts your cursor at the occurrence of the string, not at the beginning
of the node).

   <p><a name="index-M_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-66"></a>  In Emacs, <kbd>Meta-s</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>s</kbd>.  That is for
compatibility with other GNU packages that use <kbd>M-s</kbd> for a similar
kind of search command.  Both <kbd>s</kbd> and <kbd>M-s</kbd> run in Emacs the
command <code>Info-search</code>.
