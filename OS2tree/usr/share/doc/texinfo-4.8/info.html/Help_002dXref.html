<h3 class="section">1.7 Following Cross-References</h3>

<p><a name="index-cross-references-in-Info-documents-34"></a>  In Info documentation, you will see many <dfn>cross references</dfn>. 
Cross references look like this: See <a href="Help_002dCross.html#Help_002dCross">Cross</a>.  That text
is a real, live cross reference, whose name is `<samp><span class="samp">Cross</span></samp>' and which
points to the node named `<samp><span class="samp">Help-Cross</span></samp>'.  (The node name is hidden
in Emacs.  Do <kbd>M-x visible-mode</kbd> to show or hide it.)

   <p><a name="index-f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-35"></a><a name="index-Info_002dfollow_002dreference-36"></a>  There are two ways to follow a cross reference.  You can move the
cursor to it and press &lt;RET&gt;, just as in a menu.  &lt;RET&gt;
follows the cross reference that the cursor is on.  Or you can type
<kbd>f</kbd> and then specify the name of the cross reference (in this
case, `<samp><span class="samp">Cross</span></samp>') as an argument.  In Emacs Info, <kbd>f</kbd> runs
<code>Info-follow-reference</code>,

   <p>In the <kbd>f</kbd> command, you select the cross reference with its
name, so it does not matter where the cursor was.  If the cursor is on
or near a cross reference, <kbd>f</kbd> suggests that reference name in
parentheses as the default; typing &lt;RET&gt; will follow that
reference.  However, if you type a different reference name, <kbd>f</kbd>
will follow the other reference which has that name.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>f</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Cross</kbd>, and then &lt;RET&gt;.
</pre>
   <p>As you enter the reference name, you can use the &lt;DEL&gt; (or
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) key to edit your input.  If you change your mind
about following any reference, you can use <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel
the command.  Completion is available in the <kbd>f</kbd> command; you can
complete among all the cross reference names in the current node by
typing a &lt;TAB&gt;.

   <p>To get a list of all the cross references in the current node, you
can type <kbd>?</kbd> after an <kbd>f</kbd>.  The <kbd>f</kbd> continues to await a
cross reference name even after displaying the list, so if you don't
actually want to follow a reference, you should type a <kbd>Control-g</kbd>
to cancel the <kbd>f</kbd>.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>f?</kbd> to get a list of the cross references in this node.  Then
   type a <kbd>Control-g</kbd> and see how the `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>' gives up.
</pre>
   <p>The &lt;TAB&gt; and <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> key, which move between menu
items in a menu, also move between cross references outside of menus.

   <p>Sometimes a cross reference (or a node) can lead to another file (in
other words another &ldquo;manual&rdquo;), or, on occasion, even a file on a
remote machine (although Info files distributed with Emacs or the
stand-alone Info avoid using remote links).  Such a cross reference
looks like this: See <a href="../texinfo/index.html#Top">Overview of Texinfo</a>.  (After following this link, type
<kbd>l</kbd> to get back to this node.)  Here the name `<samp><span class="samp">texinfo</span></samp>'
between parentheses (shown in the stand-alone version) refers to the
file name.  This file name appears in cross references and node names
if it differs from the current file.  In Emacs, the file name is
hidden (along with other text).  (Use <kbd>M-x visible-mode</kbd> to show
or hide it.)

   <p>The remainder of this node applies only to the Emacs version.  If
you use the stand-alone version, you can type <kbd>n</kbd> immediately.

   <p>To some users, switching manuals is a much bigger switch than
switching sections.  These users like to know that they are going to
be switching to another manual (and which one) before actually doing
so, especially given that, if one does not notice, Info commands like
<kbd>t</kbd> (see the next node) can have confusing results.

   <p>If you put your mouse over the cross reference and if the cross
reference leads to a different manual, then the information appearing
in a separate box (tool tip) or in the echo area, will mention the
file the cross reference will carry you to (between parentheses). 
This is also true for menu subtopic names.  If you have a mouse, just
leave it over the `<samp><span class="samp">Overview</span></samp>' cross reference above and watch what
happens.

   <p>If you always like to have that information available without having
to move your mouse over the cross reference, set
<code>Info-hide-note-references</code> to a value other than t (see <a href="Emacs-Info-Variables.html#Emacs-Info-Variables">Emacs Info Variables</a>).  You might also want to do that if you have a lot of
cross references to files on remote machines and have non-permanent or
slow access, since otherwise you might not be able to distinguish
between local and remote links.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd> to learn more commands.
